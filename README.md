This repo is meant to contain the TuringArena versions of the algorithmic problems posed at the exam sessions for the course in Algorithms in Verona.
We opened this repo on 2019-07-26 as a place where students could train and get involved into TA by traslating the CMS versions of the exams problems into corresponding TA versions.
The future is there to see.

At the start, we initialized the repo with the CMS sources (anyhow publically available at the report https://bitbucket.org/romeorizzi/esami-algo/src/master/) of the problems, these will be gradually replaced with the TA sources of one ore more possible TA translations/renditions of each problem.
